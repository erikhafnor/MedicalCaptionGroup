True Caption: Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below. A 42-year-old woman of Indian origin was referred to a respiratory medicine department after her chest X-ray (Figure 1) revealed nodular opacifications in the lungs and bilateral pleural effusion (arrows). The patient had a 4-month history of unspecific chest and feet pains, mild dry cough, fatigue, reduced appetite, and body weight loss of 6 kg. She denied dyspnoea, sputum expectoration, haemoptysis, night sweats, or fever. On admission to the hospital, she was in good condition, her vital signs were normal, BMI was 19.2. There was no palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy or oedema; the vesicular breathing sound was reduced bibasiliary on chest auscultation. Blood tests showed elevated CRP—109.4 (N:<5) mg/L and ERS—120 (N: < 12), normal procalcitonin, normal leukocyte and neutrophil counts, decreased lymphocyte count—0.84 × 103 (N:1.18 × 103–3.74 × 103) cells/mm3.

True Caption: Contrast enhanced axial CT abdomen of a 46-year-old female illustrates intrahepatic biliary dilatation (dashed black arrows) appearing as linear or tubular and branching low-density areas in the liver. Biliary dilatation in this patient was due to an ampullary tumour which is not seen on the image. Note that normal intrahepatic bile ducts are small in calibre and only faintly seen on CT. They are considered to be dilated when they measure >3mm in diameter. It is important to appreciate normal variation in the calibre of the IVC (white arrow) which can be influenced by inspiratory effort and hydration status. It is also important to appreciate variation in the size and appearance of the stomach (H)

True Caption: Point-of-care ultrasonography image demonstrating the “whirlpool sign” (arrows) over the mesenteric vessels as indicated by their presentation in a spiral shape. Abdominal pain is the most common complaint in the emergency department (ED) [1,2]. Acute abdominal pain can be caused by a spectrum of conditions ranging from benign and self-limited diseases to surgical emergencies. Abdominal pain is caused by a variety of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders. Some frequently missed conditions include biliary pathology, appendicitis [3], diverticulitis, urogenital pathology, and even vascular emergency [1]. Therefore, the rapid and early detection of urgent conditions is crucial for managing patients efficiently. The combination of clinical and laboratory evaluation cannot reliably predict or exclude urgent conditions and can result in unnecessary or delayed interventions. Further diagnostic imaging such as point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) can help in the early identification of the cause of abdominal pain [4,5] and increase the certainty of the diagnosis [6]. The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) defines clinical ultrasonography as a diagnostic modality that provides clinically significant data that are not obtainable by inspection, palpation, auscultation, or other components of the physical examination [7]. POCUS performed and interpreted by physicians at the bedside has grown rapidly in recent decades [8], as current ultrasound equipment has become less expensive, higher quality and more compact. The use of bedside ultrasonography (or insonation), incorporated with traditional inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation have become the five pillars of bedside clinical medicine [9]. As an extension of the physical examination [10], a more generalized concept of an “ultrasound stethoscope” is used to provide directed clinical assessments [11,12]. It could provide immediate, real-time dynamic images that are correlated with a patient’s clinical condition and are easily repeatable. The main goal of POCUS in ED is to rapidly rule in or rule out a dangerous diagnosis and to solve clinical problems, such as evaluating the cause of shock [13]; shortness of breath [14]; chest pain; fever; and muscular, skeleton, or soft tissue swelling and pain [15,16] before laboratory tests. It can also help to guide the procedure [17,18] and allow checking for complications to promote patient safety [19]. Moreover, it can be used as a first-line tool for the evaluation of abdominal pain after taking the patient’s history and conducting a physical examination [4,5,20,21]. The use of ultrasonography can enable the detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain and can decrease unnecessary radiation exposure [6], decrease the need for further examinations, and decrease the frequency with which patients are admitted [22]. Nevertheless, ultrasonography is an extremely operator-dependent modality of testing. Acquiring the skills to properly manipulate and interpret images for safe integration with clinical work takes years to master [20,23]. There are many factors that can affect the quality of POCUS and the decision making involved, such as patient factors, the operator’s skills in image acquisition and interpretation, and machine quality [11]. It is important to be able to identify and differentiate artifacts and false positives and negatives to overcome the pitfalls of POCUS [24,25]. Therefore, POCUS education has been integrated into postgraduate-year training, and emergency resident training is important. It will result in physicians having more self-confidence to overcome the barriers for implementing POCUS in clinical practice. Here, we present an unusual case of abdominal pain after jejunostomy tube insertion with the use of POCUS for diagnosis. A 51-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer presented to the emergency department due to a jejunostomy tube that had been accidentally dislodged without causing abdominal pain and hemodynamically stable. A few minutes after the introduction of a new tube, the patient complained of diffuse abdominal pain. Upon examination, his body temperature was 36.6 °C, his pulse rate was 79 beats per minute, his blood pressure was 90/45 mmHg, and his respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute. The physical examination revealed a soft abdomen without rebounding tenderness or muscle guarding. The jejunostomy tube functioned well, and laboratory tests were unremarkable. The source of abdominal pain was considered benign. However, analgesic agents could not relieve abdominal pain. We performed POCUS for persistent abdominal pain to rule out bowel perforation or other dangerous etiology such as vascular emergencies, and it demonstrated mesenteric vessels presenting in a whirlpool sign, namely, in a whirling or spiral shape (Figure 1, Video S1). We tried to remove the tube; however, it could not be moved and induced progressive pain. It prompted the use of computed tomography (CT) (Figure 2, Video S2). This confirmed the presence of a small-bowel volvulus with a whirlpool sign over the jejunal branches of the superior mesenteric vessels. A surgeon was consulted, and this patient underwent surgical correction of the volvulus, without subsequent complications.

True Caption: and Video S1: A 32-year-old primigravid woman underwent obstetric ultrasound at 32 weeks of gestation because of a small-for-date uterine size. Her medical history as well as familial history was unremarkable; no underlying medical disease and no history of any pelvic surgery. The antenatal course of the current pregnancy was uneventful. Ultrasound screening for fetal anomaly at 20 weeks of pregnancy revealed normal structures and fetal biometry, with no records of pelvic pathology on sonographic examination. Ultrasound examination at this visit (32 weeks of pregnancy) showed a slightly delayed growth of the fetus (estimated fetal weight of 15th percentile). Interestingly, a cystic mass at the right adnexa, close to the lower uterine segment was noted. The mass was measured as 3.0 × 4.5 × 3.0 cm in size, well-circumscribed, unilocular, and had homogeneous low-level echoes, with swirling flow in the mass, which can be clearly visualized on the simple 2D ultrasound as seen in Figure 1 and video S1 (a supplementary file). A uterine artery aneurysm was highly suspected upon 2D ultrasound. Aneurysms of the uterine artery are rare and with an unknown true prevalence. The entity can be categorized into two groups, pseudoaneurysms and true aneurysms. Pseudoaneurysms are abnormal outpouchings or the dilatation of arteries which are bounded only by the tunica adventitia, the outermost layer of the arterial wall, whereas true aneurysms are bounded by all three layers of the arterial wall. Pseudoaneurysms typically occur when a blood vessel wall is injured and the leaking blood collects in the surrounding tissue. They can occur in patients of all ages, typically following penetrating or blunt trauma, infection, dissection, excessive effort, or as a complication of a cesarean section [1]. True aneurysms occur when the artery or vessel weakens and bulges, sometimes forming a blood-filled sac. True aneurysms of uterine arteries are extremely rare. To the best of our knowledge, a very limited number of isolated case reports have been published in the literature [2,3]. Moreover, a true aneurysm of the uterine artery has never been described during pregnancy. Therefore, its natural history remains unexplored. Nearly all cases reported in the literature are pseudoaneurysms. Additionally, most published pelvic true aneurysms involved ruptured ovarian artery aneurysms during peripartum periods [4,5,6,7,8]. The case presented here is unique in terms of being an unruptured true aneurysm of the uterine artery at the time of diagnosis and with the spontaneous development of thrombosis in the aneurysm in late pregnancy.

True Caption: Cardiac silhouette size was measured using two methods. The first method was the vertebral heart score. The base apex length and craniocaudal length were transposed onto the vertebral column and recorded as the corresponding number of vertebrae measured from the cranial edge of T4 vertebral body. VHS more than 8 was considered enlarged and likely in heart failure. The base apex length was measured from the ventral wall of the carina to apex (orange solid line). The craniocaudal length was measured perpendicular to the base-apex length, at the widest width of the cardiac silhouette (green solid line). The second method used the base apex length and compared this against the length of sternebrae 2 to 4. If the length extended beyond three sternebrae, the cardiac silhouette was considered enlarged (dashed orange line). This patient has VHS of 9 and an elongated base-apex length suggestive of congestive heart failure

The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged 4 days after TAE, without any complications or blood transfusion. After 1 month of follow-up, the patient recovered uneventfully, and no hemorrhage-related complications were observed. Iatrogenic lumbar artery injury during PDN is rare, but may be a serious condition that requires early detection and urgent treatment. Great care should be taken to avoid hemorrhagic complications, and adequate an technique and anatomical considerations are important to avoid these complications. Transarterial embolization, rather than open hematoma evacuation or laparotomy, can be a safe and effective treatment to stop active bleeding. Successful embolization of the bleeding vessel is performed using Gelfoam particles (circle).

The patient’s left eye was blind at birth and in a subsequent investigation loss of vision was postulated to have occurred due to a steal effect on the ophthalmic artery, caused by a bilateral carotid artery dissection. The patient was thought to have survived due to extensive anastomosing of carotid and cerebral arteries. The dissected portion of the left carotid artery is not visible. Retrospectively we hypothesize this to be a manifestation of either generalized arterial calcification in infancy type 2, or internal carotid artery hypoplasia

True Caption: The measurement was taken focusing on the best image for iATT without following the protocol for stiffness assessment. The two horizontal yellow lines graphically show the width (length of each line) and the length (distance between the two lines) of the iATT measurement area, which has a fixed size (length of 4 cm, from 35 to 75 mm from the skin). The yellow rectangle is the region of interest (ROI) for stiffness measurement. Because it is not possible to exclude the stiffness measurement, the stiffness ROI was intentionally positioned close to the liver capsule. This explains the huge variability between consecutive stiffness measurements with an IQR/M = 67% and a VsN always <50%.

True Caption: Classification of aneurysms based on uptake of ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIO). MRI is performed at baseline then 24 h following intravenous administration of USPIO. USPIO causes a reduction in T2* and can be quantified by comparing co-registered T2* images pre- and post- USPIO administration, presented as change in T2* represented as colour maps (as above). 'Positive uptake' of USPIO is denoted by the red colour (thresholded at change in T2* of at least 71% between pre-and post-USPIO administration), whereas blue denotes areas of no positive uptake. Of note, ‘significant’ uptake (i.e. USPIO positive) is defined as at least one focal area of USPIO uptake corresponding to 10 or more contiguous voxels of positive signal change at the aneurysm wall; USPIO uptake at the periluminal area is not thought to be clinically significant.
