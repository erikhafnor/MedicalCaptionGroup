A representative axial image reveals complete resolution of the lung lesions that were observed in the earlier PET/CT scan. Discussion Although 18F-FDG PET/CT has achieved great success in investigating malignant disorders, the imaging modality is not only specific for cancer diagnosis [13]. Since the activated inflammatory cells showed an increased expression and up-regulation of glucose transport receptors, several studies have reported the presence of high FDG uptake in acute and chronic infectious diseases such as mycobacterial, fungal, bacterial infection, sarcoidosis, radiation pneumonitis, and postoperative inflammation [14,15,16]. In this case report, we evaluated the utility of 18F-FDG PET/CT in a patient with a suspected metastatic infectious disease, and showed that it can visualize the correct foci leading to therapeutic management. CRBSI is associated with significant morbidity due to systemic infection and causes septic pulmonary emboli, which originate from the extrapulmonary site transported to the lung [17]. Like this case, clinical symptoms of septic pulmonary emboli are usually non-specific, and an active extrapulmonary focus of the infection might be apparent at the time of presentation, especially in cancer patients on chemotherapy via an indwelling central venous catheter for long durations. In conclusion, 18F-FDG PET/CT can detect septic pulmonary emboli in patients with catheter-related Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. This case report suggests that cancer patients with CRBSI might benefit from 18F-FDG PET/CT for a timely evaluation of metastatic infection and optimal management. In accordance with previous studies suggesting the clinical value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with Gram-positive bacteremia [5,10,11,18,19,20], we believe that the benefit from 18F-FDG PET/CT might be mediated by infective foci detection, earlier interventions to control infection, and the prolongation of antimicrobial treatment."
